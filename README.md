# vba-challenge
I have attached three separate screenshots for 2018, 2019 and 2020 results
I have also attached the VBA script that I applied to all three worksheets to get the results for 2018, 2019, and 2020 (which are already attached)

For this code, I used google to search a few vba functions that I was unsure of:
- I used this link to confirm how to get the range of a column: https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/vba-range/
- I uaed this link to confirm how to get the number of rows in a column: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13088090/count-number-of-rows-in-worksheet
- I used this link to confirm how to get the min and max values of a range: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42633273/finding-max-of-a-column-in-vba
